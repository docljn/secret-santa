#AIM

#Part 1: DONE
#Write a secret santa program to ensure that each person gives a gift to one other
#and each person receives a gift from one other

#original method had a major flaw: you can end up with an odd man out at the end by chance.

#rethinking the basic approach.
#use .rotate method along with .shuffle method for arrays, and then pair up entire group.

####################

#Part 2: DONE
#if the people are in groups (families/teams etc, ensure that most gifts cross groups)

####################

#Part 3:
#a way to link a name, clan and wishlist

#extension  - Part 4:
#create an input so that you can edit the list

#WORKING THOUGHTS HERE

#data storage - YAML? need to learn about it and this seems like a good excuse
#at the moment I'm not storing anything which is good for DPA but means no editing after entry
#I want to get user input to create a person, HOW.

#input would ask people to select which group they were part of, or to add a new group if not there?

#def user_input(arg)
#	puts "Please enter your #{arg}: "
#	arg = gets.chomp
#	arg
#end



#extension  - part 5:
#nake a single page website where you can add name, clan, email, wishlist and
#the result is emailed to all the participants
#you'll still need an organiser, so the website won't store any user data once the emails
#have been sent, as otherwise DPA gets involved???


#NB with the new data protection rules, you need explicit permission to even PROCESS data????
