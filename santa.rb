#AIM

#Part 1: DONE
#Write a secret santa program to ensure that each person gives a gift to one other
#and each person receives a gift from one other

#original method had a major flaw: you can end up with an odd man out at the end by chance.

#rethinking the basic approach.
#use .rotate method along with .shuffle method for arrays, and then pair up entire group.

####################

#Part 2: DONE
#if the people are in groups (families/teams etc, ensure that most gifts cross groups)

####################

#Part 3: DONE BUT REFACTORING TO DO
#a way to link a name, clan and wishlist for each participant

####################

#Part 4:
#create an input/output interface so that you can accept data from users
#and a way to edit the list

#WORKING THOUGHTS HERE
#once a person has been added, output to screen
#and add to the displayed list each time you add a person
#find a way to edit a person if you've made a mistake

#give a choice of clan/team/family from those already entered, or 0 to add a new one

#data storage - YAML? need to learn about it and this seems like a good excuse
#at the moment I'm not storing anything which is good for DPA but means no editing after entry

#START OF ACTUAL CODE

#create some sample people and give them different clan attributes
#create a list of the clans used / people created as each person is created

#this is a shortcut to save me typing everything in
#eventually this should probably be a csv / YAML data store?
#and the input will write to this each time a new person is added?

#extension  - part 5:
#nake a single page website where you can add name, clan, email, wishlist and
#the result is emailed to all the participants (i.e. each receives their recipient and the recipient's wishlist)
#you'll still need an organiser, so the website won't store any user data once the emails
#have been sent, as otherwise DPA gets involved???
#need to check what is needed for processing of user information
#NB with the new data protection rules, you need explicit permission to even PROCESS data????
