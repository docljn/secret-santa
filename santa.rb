#AIM

#Part 1: DONE
#Write a secret santa program to ensure that each person gives a gift to one other
#and each person receives a gift from one other

#original method had a major flaw: you can end up with an odd man out at the end by chance.

#rethinking the basic approach.
#use .rotate method along with .shuffle method for arrays, and then pair up entire group.

####################

#Part 2: DONE
#if the people are in groups (families/teams etc, ensure that most gifts cross groups)

####################

#Part 3:
#a way to link a name, clan and wishlist
#data storage - YAML? need to learn about it and this seems like a good excuse

#WORKING IDEAS HERE

#start thinking about classes?
#Person(name, clan, wishlist)??
#a way to select people by clan
#how to find out what the clans are?

#but I want to get user input to create a person, HOW.

class Person

	attr_accessor(:pname, :clan, :wishlist)


	def initialize(pname, clan = "main", wishlist = "anything under Â£10")
		@@clans ||= []
		@@members ||= []
		@pname = pname
		@clan = clan
		@wishlist = wishlist
	end



	def inspect
		"#{@pname}"
	end


	#this doesn't do what I want it to
	def collect
	@@members << self
	end


	def clan_collect
		unless @@clans.include?(clan)
		@@clans << clan
		end
		p @@clans
	end


	def self.output_clans
		@@clans
	end


	def self.output_members
		@@members
	end


end

#maybe a clan class,
#or would I be better off with a hash? that way I don't need to worry about names?
class Clan
	attr_accessor(:cname, :cmember)

		@cname = cname

#METHODS BELONGING TO THE PROGRAM NOT THE CLASS!





#create some sample people and give them different clan attributes
#this will eventually be done as part of accepting user data
#keep a list of the clans used

#extension  - Part 4:
#create an input so that you can edit the list
#input would ask people to select which group they were part of, or to add a new group if not there?

#	arg = gets.chomp
#	arg
#end


#extension  - part 5:
#nake a single page website where you can add name, clan, email, wishlist and
#the result is emailed to all the participants
#you'll still need an organiser, so the website won't store any user data once the emails
#have been sent, as otherwise DPA gets involved???
