#Write a secret santa program to ensure that each person gives a gift to one other
#and each person receives a gift from one other

#extension: the output will be blind, so that if you type in your name, you are given 
#the option to type in your wishlist, and then given
#the name of your recipient and their wishlist

#extension: if the people are in groups (families/teams etc, ensure that most gifts cross groups)
